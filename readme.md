This repo was done as an interview task to Elecard.

It still works, but server with JSON file is down, so it's not possible to see how everything is displayed and filtered. However the code is still available.

It's written with html+css+js (vanilla+lazy loading framework + paginator framework + jQuery) stack in Brackets app (so no constructors were used).

You can simply download and open HTML. It will partially work. Feel free to use it in your products if you find it useful.
